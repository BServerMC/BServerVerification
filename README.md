# BServer Verification #
A slightly modified version of VerifyMe, for the BServerMod. This does [discord](https://discordapp.com/), but not forums. We removed the forums feature for this one since BServer uses [Enjin](https://www.enjin.com/) and not [ProBroads](https://www.proboards.com/).

# VerifyMe #
VerifyMe is a plugin that integrates with the ProBoards forum software and/or discord to allow admins on the TotalFreedom server to verify without a telnet, telnet clan or senior needing to be online!
